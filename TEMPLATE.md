### About Me

-Self confessed epistemophilic with an innate disposition to excel in multilateral fields beyond the corporate world.
as they say "Teamwork makes the dream work!"
Striving to contribute towards a holistically better future. regardless of the premise or the scale.
P.S i get my dopamine spikes from doing interesting things like photoshop or getting something to work in python, IOT, Figma,AI, ML, front end.



#### Leadership and Influence: 

- Sincerety or arthamarthatha along with the ardent desire to stick on with the values will always pave the way for success in the longrun and thats my mantra or what i believe in..apart from countless leadership and team player roles in my high school,college,youth welfare club.. Conducting young innovators program orientation sessions across colleges in malappuram district as a district cordinator intern throttled me in a way that know not that i needed .

#### Networking: 

- as the current co commuucommunity lead of our college. im thrilled to be doing what i love .. whch is connnecting and getting to know people their strengths their intrests their vision etc. and i can guaratee that will not be missing out on that part.

#### As a Top 100 Member: 

- im applying so that i challenge my self to excel my self as a student doing his bachelors in Computer science and im obliged as a keralite to be person who is willing and working towards the betterment of our nation and contribute to FOSS for a better futere and personal contentment.

#### Career Plan:

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: `required field`

- on the advent of KSUM and IEDCs, KDISC and YIPs it gave me an optimistic perspective of the future of our state kerala. as we know that kerala is the state with most coders, we can conclude that this stat alone will translate to rest of the tech stack. be it designing etc. this foreces us to believe that we are on the right path when it comes to the progress of technolugy and fostering innovation.

#### History of Community Engagement:

- i do hope on python discord sever and do engage with devs and help out newbies within my capabilities
